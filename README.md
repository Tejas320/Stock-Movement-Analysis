## Objective 
Develop a machine learning model that predicts stock movements by scraping data from social media platforms like Twitter, Reddit, or Telegram. The model should extract insights from user-generated content, such as stock discussions, predictions, or sentiment analysis, and accurately forecast stock price trends.
## Task Requirements
### 1. Data Scraping: 
○ Select one platform: Twitter, Reddit, or Telegram.
○ Scrape relevant data from specific handles, subreddits, or Telegram channels focused on stock market discussions and predictions.
○ Clean and preprocess the data, ensuring it's ready for model input (e.g., removing noise, handling missing data).
### 2. Data Analysis (Optional):
○ Perform sentiment analysis or topic modeling on the scraped data.
○ Extract key features such as sentiment polarity, frequency of mentions, or any other indicators relevant to stock movements.
### 3. Prediction Model:
○ Build a machine learning model that takes the processed data as input and predicts stock movements.
○ Test the model's accuracy on historical data or known stock trends.
○ Provide a detailed evaluation of the model's performance, including metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and any improvements that can be made.
### 4. Technical Skills Required:
○ Proficiency in Python, with experience in web scraping (using libraries such as BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, or Selenium).
○ Knowledge of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for sentiment analysis and text mining.
○ Experience in building and evaluating machine learning models using libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.
